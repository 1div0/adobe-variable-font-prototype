# Adobe Variable Font Prototype

Variable font in OpenType-CFF2 and TrueType formats, made from [UFO] sources derived from
[Source Serif Pro], designed by [Frank Grießhammer].

The font files are intended to serve as test cases for environments and workflows that aim
to support [OpenType variable fonts].

The fonts are functional but are not considered *shippable* — see [Current limitations].
We plan to update them as the tools improve.

## Font characteristics

**Adobe Variable Font Prototype** contains two axes — weight and contrast — five design
masters, and eight named instances — Extra Light, Light, Regular, Semibold, Bold, Black,
Black Medium Contrast, and Black High Contrast.

The weight axis has an intermediate master (**master_1**), and the design space can be
thought of as having the shape of a square triangle. This is achieved by using **master_0**
twice, and by having **master_4** along the *diagonal* defined by **master_0** and
**master_3**. This arrangement effectively collapses half of the original rectangular-shaped
design space, concealing interpolation imperfections that would be visible otherwise.
See [design space notes](DesignSpaceNotes) for more details.

The font also contains transitional designs for the glyphs $ (dollar) and ¢ (cent), in
which the inner-counter part of the stroke is removed, when the weight axis reaches Bold
or heavier.

The font supports the [Adobe Latin 2] character set, GPOS kerning, and the GSUB features
listed below.

    pnum (proportional figures)
    tnum (tabular figures [default])
    onum (old-style a.k.a. text figures)
    lnum (lining figures [default])
    zero (slashed zero)
    case (case-sensitive forms such as parentheses, hyphen)
    liga (ligatures fi fl ft)

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build the **OpenType-CFF2 version** (AdobeVFPrototype.otf), you need to have installed a
custom build (2.5.65463 or later) of the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType] which can
be downloaded from <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/AFDKO-Variable-Font-Support.html>

To build the **TrueType version** (AdobeVFPrototype.ttf), you need to have installed a
customized fork of [fontmake] which is available at <https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/fontmake>

[Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType]: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html
[fontmake]: https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake

### Build command

macOS and Linux:

```sh
sh buildFont.sh
```

Windows:

```sh
cmd buildFont.sh
```

### Build process

The **buildFont.sh** script first builds the OpenType-CFF2 font with the FDK tools
`buildMasterOTFs` and `buildCFF2VF`.
The first tool generates OpenType-CFF fonts from each of the UFO masters. And the
second takes the set of OTFs built in the previous step, and combines them to produce
the CFF2 variable font. More details about the process are provided at
<http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/AFDKO-Variable-Font-Support.html>

The CFF2 table is then subroutinized with FDK's `tx` tool, and the modified table
is replaced in place using FDK's `sfntedit` tool.

Next, `fontmake` is used for building the variable TrueType font. The `GSUB`
table of this font is then patched with `ttx` to add a *[feature variations table]*
— this patching is what enables the transitional glyphs to work.

Finally, `sfntedit` is used for copying/replacing several tables between the
OTF and TTF fonts.

## Current limitations

* The OpenType-CFF2 font cannot be displayed by macOS or Windows because their font
rasterizers do not yet support the newer `CFF2` table. (As of this moment, the only tool
that can render OT-CFF2 fonts is [FontView]).
* Neither of the fonts is hinted.
